When dealing with high-dimensional data, regularization is necessary to prevent overfitting and improve prediction performance. Feature selection helps to identify the most relevant features and reduce the dimensionality of the data, which can improve the efficiency and interpretability of the analysis. By selecting a subset of informative features, regularization techniques can effectively estimate the high-dimensional covariance matrix and improve prediction performance in cases where there is limited information available. Therefore, feature selection plays a crucial role in high-dimensional data analysis by enhancing regularization and prediction performance.",multi_context,"[{'source': '/Users/i748920/Desktop/llms-learning/pdf-chatbot-app/data/short-chap18-elements-of-statistical-learning-book/chap18 copy.pdf', 'page': 2, 'filename': '/Users/i748920/Desktop/llms-learning/pdf-chatbot-app/data/short-chap18-elements-of-statistical-learning-book/chap18 copy.pdf - page: 2'}]",True
What is the role of regularized approaches in genomics and computational biology?,"['This is page 649\nPrinter: Opaque this\n18\nHigh-Dimensional Problems: p≫N\n18.1 When pis Much Bigger than N\nIn this chapter we discuss prediction problems in which the n umber of\nfeaturespis much larger than the number of observations N, often written\np≫N.
